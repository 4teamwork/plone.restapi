Serialization
=============

Throughout the REST API, content needs to be serialized and deserialized to and from JSON representations.

In general, the format used for serializing content when reading from the API is the same as is used to submit content to the API for writing.

Basic Types
-----------

Basic Python data types that have a corresponding type in JSON, like integers or strings, will simply be translated between the Python type and the respective JSON type.

Dates and Times
---------------

Since JSON doesn't have native support for dates/times, the Python/Zope datetime types will be serialized to an ISO 8601 datestring.

======================================= ======================================
Python                                  JSON
======================================= ======================================
``time(19, 45, 55)``                    ``'19:45:55'``
``date(2015, 11, 23)``                  ``'2015-11-23'``
``datetime(2015, 11, 23, 19, 45, 55)``  ``'2015-11-23T19:45:55'``
``DateTime('2015/11/23 19:45:55')``     ``'2015-11-23T19:45:55'``
======================================= ======================================


RichText fields
---------------

RichText fields will be serialized as follows:

A ``RichTextValue`` like

.. code:: python

    RichTextValue(u'<p>Hall√∂chen</p>',
                  mimeType='text/html',
                  outputMimeType='text/html')

will be serialized to

.. code:: json

    {
      "data": "<p>Hall\u00f6chen</p>",
      "content-type": "text/html",
      "encoding": "utf-8"
    }

File Fields
-----------

Download (serialization)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For download, the file field will simply be serialized to a string that contains the download URL for the file.

.. code:: json

      {
        "...": "",
        "@type": "File",
        "title": "My file",
        "file": "http://localhost:55001/plone/file/@@download/file"
      }

That URL points to the regular Plone
download view.

This means that when accessing that URL, your request won't be handled by the API but a regular Plone browser view.
Therefore you must **not** send the ``Accept: application/json`` header in this case.

Upload (deserialization)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a field of type ``Named[Blob]File`` (Dexterity) or ``FileField`` (Archetypes), represent the field content as a dictionary with these four keys:

- ``data`` - the base64 encoded contents of the file
- ``encoding`` - the encoding you used to encode the data, so usually `base64`
- ``content-type`` - the MIME type of the file
- ``filename`` - the name of the file, including extension

.. code:: json

      {
        "...": "",
        "@type": "File",
        "title": "My file",
        "file": {
            "data": "TG9yZW0gSXBzdW0uCg==",
            "encoding": "base64",
            "filename": "lorem.txt",
            "content-type": "text/plain"}
      }


Relations
---------

Serialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``RelationValue`` will be serialized to a short summary representation of the referenced object:

.. code:: json

    {
      '@id': 'http://nohost/plone/doc1',
      '@type': 'DXTestDocument',
      'title': 'Document 1',
      'description': 'Description'
    }

The ``RelationList`` containing that reference will be represended as a list in JSON.

Deserialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to set a relation when creating or updating content, you can use one
of several ways to specify relations:

======================================= ======================================
Type                                    Example
======================================= ======================================
UID                                     ``'9b6a4eadb9074dde97d86171bb332ae9'``
IntId                                   ``123456``
Path                                    ``'/plone/doc1'``
URL                                     ``'http://localhost:8080/plone/doc1'``
======================================= ======================================
